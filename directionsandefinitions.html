    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
 
        *People have to be involved. If you see a car do a motion, but cannot see the person before and after, then
            you should not analyze the action.<br/>
        *Track one person at a time, and go back to track each person. Your button clicks will analyze the time in
            the video when the action is performed.<br/>
        *Do not track people who know the camera is there. They will more than likely be acting and not act how they
            would truly repond in a similar situation.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When a video starts, you will press the button of the action that corresponds with what you see on the
        screen. If you are able to find the action within a second or two of it being done, that is great. If not,
        move on to the current action. Each video will place 3 times and you can make sure to track the action
        later.</p>
    <p>Each time you press an action button, the action, time you pressed it, your username and url of the video
        will be recorded.</p>
